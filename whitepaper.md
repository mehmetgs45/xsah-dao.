## 6. XSah DAO – Decentralized Governance / Merkeziyetsiz Yönetişim

XSah DAO is the decentralized governance system of XSah Coin — a token born from the spirit of resistance in the Kurdish mountains.

XSah DAO empowers the community to decide on the future of the project. Instead of a single authority, XSah holders shape its path together.

**Through XSah DAO, token holders can:**

- 🗳 Vote on proposals that affect the XSah ecosystem  
- 💡 Suggest ideas and cultural initiatives  
- 🧭 Participate in transparent, fair community decision-making  
- 📢 Speak as a collective voice of freedom and resistance

In its current phase, XSah DAO offers an on-site voting simulation. Future plans include full integration with Realms and Snapshot for on-chain voting and treasury management.

> **“XSah is not just a coin — it is a voice for the people.”**

### 🇹🇷 Türkçe (Aynı içeriğin çevirisi)

XSah DAO, XSah Coin’in merkeziyetsiz yönetişim sistemidir. Direnişin ve halkın iradesinin doğduğu Kürt dağlarından ilham alan bu yapı, topluluğa projeyi birlikte yönlendirme gücü verir.

**XSah DAO ile token sahipleri:**

- 🗳 XSah ekosistemini ilgilendiren oylamalara katılabilir  
- 💡 Yeni fikir ve kültürel projeler önerebilir  
- 🧭 Şeffaf ve adil bir topluluk sürecine katılabilir  
- 📢 Özgürlüğün ve direnişin kolektif sesi olabilir

Şu anda demo oylama sistemi xsah-dao sayfasında aktiftir. İlerleyen aşamalarda Realms ve Snapshot ile zincir üstü yönetişim entegre edilecektir.
