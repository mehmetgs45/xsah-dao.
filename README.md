<h1>🗳️ XSah DAO</h1>

**XSah DAO** is the decentralized governance layer of XSah Coin — a movement rooted in the Kurdish mountains, symbolizing **freedom, culture, and resistance**.

We are not just creating a token — we're building a people-powered governance system that honors heritage, empowers communities, and resists centralization.
